VPN configurations for share

## Read my article [“A Quick Way to Restore Access to the World Wide Web and Youtube”](https://zakutsky.com/vps-fast-wireguard/)
Briefly talked about the easiest way to set up an internet blocking bypass. How to set up an X-ray server in one click and how to configure selective routing in the VPN client.

## About Shadowrocket client
I got most of the information from [Mikhail Tugushev's article](https://mishatugushev.ru/blog/?go=all/shadowrocket-seamless-ios/) and [his repo](https://github.com/misha-tgshv/shadowrocket-configuration-file/tree/main).

## Amnezia VPN (X-ray server)
Official repo [here](https://github.com/amnezia-vpn/amnezia-client).

I tried this method and it works fine, although it may lack selective routing settings on the server.

## 3X-UI (X-ray server)
Great article on [installing and configuring 3X-UI](https://habr.com/ru/articles/785186/).

Following all the instructions, I got a working server. It may take a whole day the first time, and even more if you have no experience with linux.

## Suitable VPS

### [Vdsina.com](https://www.vdsina.com/?partner=wq7p9l82sc)
- Standart VPS/VDS virtual servers for 0.75 $/month - profitable for start and testing. 
- No personal information is required.
- Various payment methods are available.

### [Beget.com](https://beget.com/p2178830)
- Very reliable and well-known service
- I tried a Latvian VPS for the VPN server.
I didn't encountered any restrictions or problems - I can safely recommend it.
